📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction – AIML Project

🔍 Project Overview 
This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn (whether a customer will leave the service or not) using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
The goal is to demonstrate basic ML workflow, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

📁 Dataset Source:-
•Dataset Name: Telco Customer Churn
•Link:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
•File Format: Excel (.xlsx)
•Source: IBM Sample Dataset (commonly used for churn analysis)
Description:
•The dataset includes customer details such as:
•Gender, senior citizen status, partner and dependents
•Tenure and subscribed services (Phone, Internet, Streaming, etc.)
•Contract type, payment method, monthly and total charges
•Target variable: Churn (Yes / No)

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used:-
•Python
•Pandas
•NumPy
•Matplotlib
•Seaborn
•Scikit-learn


📑 Steps Performed in the Project:-
1) Imported essential Python libraries for:
   •Data manipulation (pandas, numpy)
   •Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
   •Machine learning (scikit-learn)

2) Load the Dataset:-
   •Loaded the Telco Customer Churn CSV file using Pandas.
   •Added error handling to ensure the dataset is available before execution.

3) Initial Data Exploration:-
   •Displayed the first few rows of the dataset.
   Checked:
   •Dataset shape (rows & columns)
   •Column names
   •Data types
   •Missing values
   •Performed basic understanding of the dataset structure.

4) Data Cleaning:-
   •Converted TotalCharges column to numeric format.
   •Handled missing values by removing invalid rows.
   •Ensured all numerical columns were correctly formatted.

5) Categorical Data Encoding:-
   •Converted categorical variables into numerical format using:
   •Label Encoding
   •Converted the target column Churn into binary values:
   Yes → 1
   No → 0

6) Feature Selection:-
   •Removed unnecessary columns such as:
   •customerID
   •Selected relevant features for training the model.

7) Train-Test Split:-
   •Split the dataset into:
   •Training set
   •Testing set
   •Used 80% training and 20% testing data.
       
8) Feature Scaling:-
   •Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical features.
   •Scaling ensured better model performance and convergence.

9) Model Building:-
   •Implemented three machine learning classification algorithms to predict customer churn:
   •Logistic Regression
   •Decision Tree Classifier
   •Random Forest Classifier
   •Each model was trained using the training dataset after preprocessing and feature scaling (where required).

10) Model Prediction:-
    •Generated predictions on the test dataset for all three models.
    •Converted predicted probabilities into binary class labels (Churn / No Churn).     

11) Model Evaluation:-
    •Evaluated each model using the following metrics:
    •Accuracy Score
    •Confusion Matrix
    Additionally:
    •Visualized confusion matrices using heatmaps for better interpretation.
    •Compared model performances based on evaluation results.

12) Result Interpretation:-
    For each model, the following were analyzed:
    •True Positives (TP) – Correctly predicted churned customers
    •True Negatives (TN) – Correctly predicted non-churned customers
    •False Positives (FP) – Non-churned customers predicted as churn
    •False Negatives (FN) – Churned customers predicted as non-churn
    •This analysis helped understand strengths and weaknesses of each model in churn prediction.    
   
  Final Results:-

  •All three models were successfully trained and evaluated.
  •Random Forest achieved the best performance among the models.
  •Logistic Regression provided a strong baseline with good interpretability.
  •Decision Tree offered clear decision rules but was more prone to overfitting.
  •The confusion matrices demonstrate each model’s ability to distinguish between churned and non-churned customers.   

  Conclusion:-
  •This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, including:
  •Data preprocessing
  •Feature encoding and scaling
  •Training multiple models
  •Model evaluation and comparison
